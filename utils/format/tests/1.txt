Given the equations \(2x = 5y\) and \(7y = 10z\), we need to find the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) expressed as a common fraction. We start by manipulating these equations to isolate \(z\) in terms of \(x\).

1. From \(2x = 5y\), we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
   \[
   y = \frac{2x}{5}
   \]

2. Substitute \(y = \frac{2x}{5}\) into the second equation \(7y = 10z\):
   \[
   7 \left(\frac{2x}{5}\right) = 10z
   \]

3. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{14x}{5} = 10z
   \]

4. Solve for \(z\) in terms of \(x\):
   \[
   z = \frac{14x}{50} = \frac{7x}{25}
   \]

5. Therefore, the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) is:
   \[
   \frac{z}{x} = \frac{\frac{7x}{25}}{x} = \frac{7}{25}
   \]

Thus, the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) is \(\frac{7}{25}\).

Let me verify my proof for the problem about finding the value of z/x when 2x = 5y and 7y = 10z...

Looking at my current solution, I'm using `field_simp [h₀] at *` followed by `nlinarith`. Let me check if this approach is correct.

Wait, I see an issue here. The `field_simp` tactic is attempting to simplify expressions involving field operations, but it seems to be failing. This suggests that I'm not handling the algebraic relationships correctly.

Let me reconsider this approach. When I look at my equations:
- 2x = 5y (from h₁)
- 7y = 10z (from h₂)

First, I need to express y in terms of x. From h₁:
2x = 5y ⟹ y = (2x)/5

Then, I substitute this into h₂:
7y = 10z ⟹ 7((2x)/5) = 10z ⟹ (14x)/5 = 10z ⟹ z = (14x)/50 = (7x)/25

So z/x = (7x)/25/x = 7/25

The issue with my current approach is that I'm trying to use `field_simp` and `nlinarith` without properly setting up the algebraic relationships. I need to explicitly manipulate the equations to isolate z/x.

A better approach would be to:
1. Express y in terms of x using h₁
2. Substitute this into h₂ to get an equation involving z and x
3. Then solve for z/x

For the `field_simp` tactic to work, I need to provide it with the necessary hypotheses to handle the field operations. I should include:
- The non-zero conditions h₀ (x ≠ 0)
- The equations h₁ and h₂ as additional facts

Also, I need to provide the `linarith` tactic with these facts explicitly, rather than just using `nlinarith` alone. The `linarith` tactic needs these explicit facts about the relationships between x, y, and z.

So a better approach would be to:
```
field_simp [h₀, h₁, h₂]
linarith
```

This would allow the `linarith` tactic to use the algebraic relationships between the variables to simplify the expression z/x to 7/25, which is exactly what we need to prove.

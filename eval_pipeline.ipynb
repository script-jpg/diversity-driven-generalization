Let's substitute these values into the formula:\\n$V = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times 30 \\\\times 6.5$\\n\\nLet's calculate this step by step:\\n$V = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\times 30 \\\\times 6.5 = 10 \\\\times 6.5 = 65$\\n\\nSo the volume of the cone should be 65 cubic units.\\n\\nNow, let's formalize this in Lean 4:\\n\\n```tactics\\nimport Mathlib\\nimport Aesop\\n\\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\\n\\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\\n```\\n\\nWe need to import the necessary libraries and open the appropriate namespaces to work with real numbers and arithmetic operations.\\n\\nNow, let's define the theorem statement:\\n\\n```tactics\\ntheorem mathd_algebra_478 (b h v : ℝ) (h₀ : 0 < b ∧ 0 < h ∧ 0 < v) (h₁ : v = 1 / 3 * (b * h))\\n    (h₂ : b = 30) (h₃ : h = 13 / 2) : v = 65 := by\\n```\\n\\nThe theorem states that for positive real numbers $b$, $h$, and $v$, where $v = \\\\frac{1}{3}b \\\\cdot h$ (the cone volume formula), if $b = 30$ and $h = 6.5$, then $v = 65$.\\n\\nLet's complete the proof:\\n\\n```tactics\\nrw [h₁, h₂, h₃]\\nnorm_num\\n```\\n\\nIn the proof, we:\\n1. Rewrote `v` using the equation `h₁`: `v = 1 / 3 * (b * h)`\\n2. Substituted `b = 30` and `h = 13/2` (which is 6.5) into the equation\\n3. After substitution, we have `v = 1/3 * (30 * 13/2)`\\n4. The `norm_num` tactic calculated this arithmetic expression:\\n   `v = 1/3 * 30 * 13/2 = 10 * 13/2 = 130/2 = 65`\\n\\nSo we've successfully proven that the volume of the cone is 65 cubic units.\\n</think>\\n```lean4\\nimport Mathlib\\nimport Aesop\\n\\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\\n\\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\\n\\n/-- The volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \\\\frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height.

-- Minimal Lean 4 project for theorem planning testing
-- TODO: Later replace with real OpenAI miniF2F repository:
-- https://github.com/openai/miniF2F
-- Real path would be something like: lean/src/test.lean
-- Real commit: Use latest stable commit from miniF2F repo

import Mathlib.Data.Nat.GCD.Basic
import Mathlib.Tactic

-- Our test theorem for the planner system
theorem imo_1959_q1 (n : â„•) : Nat.gcd (21 * n + 4) (14 * n + 3) = 1 := by
  sorry

-- Additional theorems can be added here for testing
-- These would normally come from the real miniF2F dataset
